</p>
<p>
As you can see, there are already a few other resources that exist.
We will go ahead and create a new one.

<p>
Select the "password" option. This will allow you to create a username as well as a password to login to your virtual machine. 
You can also see the pricing for the virtual machine off to the far right. Click the "review and create" button to proceed.
